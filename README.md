Auction-on-Pi

The Problem: The current system of auctions involves relying on a third-party intermediary, who can often times cause delays, errors, and raise questions over the legitimacy of the process. In many auctions there exists the potential for bid rigging and fraudulent behavior which could lead to costly litigation for all parties involved.

The Solution: By building an auction app on Pi blockchain we will create a distributed online auction system that is completely transparent, immutable, and secure. All auction transactions are recorded as data on the Pi blockchain ledger ensuring that every interaction is documented and stored permanently. Blockchain technology also offers smart contract technology which helps to automate many processes associated with negotiations between buyers and sellers resulting in higher accuracy, efficiency and cost savings.

Objective of Project: Our goal is to create a reliable and secure platform for buyers and sellers to interact using Pi blockchain technology so that all parties can trust the integrity of their agreements. We want to provide a faster marketplace where bidders can safely compete without worrying about tampering or interference from third parties. We want to reduce errors in bid placements while eliminating fraud through our use of encryption schemes and other advanced security measures. Lastly, we wish to provide an easy-to-use experience with minimal learning curve for users that are unfamiliar or hesitant about leveraging digital assets for bidding purposes.
